# Gatsby Node APIs

Contains [helper functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) for creating nodes and pages in Gatsby.

## Notes on multilingual content

Gatsby mirrors Drupal's path created by [pathauto](https://www.drupal.org/project/pathauto). In terms of an API, a path is consisted by an `alias` and a `langcode`.

`locale` is a variable used in Gatsby's `pageContext` to set content's language.
