Once an initiative gathers 1 million signatures with <a href=\"#\" class=\"ecl-link\">minimum thresholds</a> reached in at least 7 countries, the European Commission must decide whether or not to take action.</p><p class=\"ecl-u-type-paragraph\">The rules and procedures governing the citizens' initiative are set out in an <a href=\"#\" class=\"ecl-link\">EU Regulation</a> adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in February 2011.</p>"

However, organisations can promote or support initiatives provided that they do so with full transparency.</p><p class=\"ecl-u-type-paragraph\">The citizens' committee must register its initiative on this website before starting to collect statements of support from citizens. Once the registration is confirmed, organisers have one year to collect signatures.</p><p class=\"ecl-u-type-paragraph\"><em>* Citizens do not need to be registered to vote, just old enough.</em></p><p class=\"ecl-u-type-paragraph\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ecl-link\">Lear more here</a></p>"

If the Commission decides to put forward a legislative proposal, the normal legislative procedure kicks off: the Commission proposal is submitted to the legislator (generally the European Parliament and the Council or in some cases only the Council) and, if adopted, it becomes law.</p><p class=\"ecl-u-type-paragraph\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"ecl-link\">Lear more here</a></p>"
