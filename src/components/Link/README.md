# Links

This folder contains 2 very similary components, which are to be used only when a given link has an icon.

- `LinkEcl` is very close to native ECL React implementation
- `LinkGatsby` is almost the same as the previous one, but uses [GatsbyJS's `Link`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/)

By default, aim for using default's Gatsby Link in order to get all its benefits. Use `LinkEcl` for external links which have icons, and the `LinkGatsby` for internal links with icons.
