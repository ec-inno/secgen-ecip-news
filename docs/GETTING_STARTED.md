# Getting started

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 8.16.0
- yarn >= 1.16.0

We recommend you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

From project's root folder run the following:

- `nvm install`
- `nvm use`

This will install and set the right version of Node.js for the project based on `.nvmrc`.
